CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:60 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlivox_ros_driver2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "livox_ros_driver2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "livox_ros_driver2"
  with any of the following names:

    livox_ros_driver2Config.cmake
    livox_ros_driver2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "livox_ros_driver2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "livox_ros_driver2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "livox_ros_driver2" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
